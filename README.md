## High-level code of conduct

At Mainesec, we wholeheartedly embrace diversity and inclusivity as fundamental pillars of our online community. We are committed to fostering an environment where people from all walks of life, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, religion, or background, feel not only welcomed but valued. We believe that our collective strength lies in our differences, and we celebrate the unique perspectives, experiences, and voices that each member brings to our community. Discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of any kind has no place here. Together, we aspire to create a safe and supportive space where everyone can engage, learn, and grow together as part of our vibrant and inclusive family.

Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the admins.

Our anti-harassment policy can be found [here](anti-harassment)

## Updates

Policy changes are generally made by members of the admin team listed above, but PR submissions from the community are welcome.

All changes should be made by creating a new branch, making the desired changes, and then opening a pull request for feedback. Please tag one of the organizers for a review.
